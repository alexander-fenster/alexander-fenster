## Alexander Fenster

Hello! My name is Alexander Fenster, I'm a software developer
currently working for Pure Storage in Santa Clara, California.

Before Pure, I worked for Google, Microsoft, Parallels, and Intel.

### Projects

Besides the code I write for my employer, I like writing code for
other random things. Some smaller projects I care about are:

- An [online C language course for beginners](https://c-course.com) I started working on,
remembering my past experience teaching students;

- An [app to play Durak](https://durak.click/app) (for both iOS and Android),
a classic Eastern European card game, with your friends; match making is very simple and
no registration is needed;

- A [chat bot to practice for US citizenship test](https://us-civics-bot.click)
is an old style–no LLMS!–chatbot to study civics and government questions for the test;

- An [app to play piano melodies with chords](https://pianoapp.click), as you would do
on a piano accordion;

- A [handmade ceramics shop](https://fenstea.com) that my wife Alexandra and I made for her art;

- My attempt to [summarize what I know about low carb diet and glucose](https://t2d.life),
because this is an interesting topic to figure out!

### My vibe coding experiments

- A [match-3 game](https://mindful-match3.app) I made without ever editing any code, only by talking to Cursor and ChatGPT.
Well, actually _publishing_ it and setting up a domain required some manual actions, but the code is fully vibe coded.
